# ARRAYS

Question 1
Restrictions:
Given char[] someArray;
Given int index; //remove index
Return new array with index removed
{a, b, c, d, e}
{a, b, d, e}

Question 2
Given two sorted arrays of integers,
find the k'th element of the array.
Example
a1 = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9]
a2 = [1, 4, 8, 10] k = 5 Output: 6

Question 3
Given an array of ints, unsorted(no certain order)
Ex. [12, 32, 1, 23, 47, 0, 40]
Req: method that with return same numbers, all “heavier” numbers towards end, “lighter” numbers towards beginning

Question 4
Given an array of ints, check if there is duplications, return ONLY the duplicates in a new array
[1,7,17,23,17,42,7,8]

Question 5
Given 2 String arrays (String[])
String[] str1 = { sql, java, cobol, c++, php, swift}
String[] str2 = {coldfusion, c++, emacs, java, python}
Task: return a new array with only the duplicates between the two
Ex. String[] newstr = {java, c++}

Question 6
Give:{1,3,5,4}
Sum of all Subarrays

Question 7
Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays (string values)
Array1 : [Python, JAVA, PHP, C#, C++, SQL]
Array2 : [MySQL, SQL, SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, JAVA]
Common element is : [JAVA, SQL]

Question 8
